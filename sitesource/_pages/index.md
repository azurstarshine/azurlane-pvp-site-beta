title: Azur Lane EN PvP Guide
---


The all-in-one PvP guide / fleet tierlist, strictly for EN servers.

Come join the Azur Lane EN PvP Guide Server! <https://discord.gg/HahgBcSdaE>

# DISCLAIMERS

This guide assumes the following:

1. You are already familiar with the Exercises page on the Azur Lane Wiki. If not, you can find it here: <https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Exercise>.
2. You play on an EN server. (Also known as Azur Lane Global). These are currently: Avrora, Sandy, Washington, Lexington, Amagi, Little Enterprise.
3. Fleet Tiering is based on overall (weighted average) ATTACK WINRATE against current meta environment. Other factors like speed of matches will be noted but won't directly affect the tiering.
4. The Tier List is not exhaustive and there are many other viable fleet comps you can create. Only the most common and influential are listed for convenience and discussion.
5. All ships in the fleet comps shown on the tier list are maximum level and maximum PR/DR development level.

Without any further ado... Please venture on into the next tab, commander. Inazuma will guide you there.
